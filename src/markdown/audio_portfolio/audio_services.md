## Audio Services
List of services that I can do for your audio needs.  I have an Associates Degree in Digital Audio Engineering and have done a handful of projects.  Robert's audio production service is currently called Comet of Dreams and most projects will be uploaded with Comet of Dreams along with most of them.

#### Sound Mixing
Applies EQ adjustments, leveling, panning, timebased effects (reverb, delay, flanging, phase correction, etc), and dynamics (compression, expanding, etc) to enhance the sound of edited recordings of each track for each song.  Also applies these effects on the overall song as well.

#### Audio Editing
Makes sure to remove lip noises on voice/ vocal tracks.  Also makes sure that audio transients line up to the grid for drums, guitar(s), bass, percussion, and other instruments of raw recodings.

#### Podcast Editing
Will do everything in Audio Editing Service plus line up each podcast episode with based off of the format (preselected episode music, pre recorded ad, voices, etc).

#### Demoing/ Songwriting
Depending on what your needs are; I can write musical instrument parts (or the whole song) for any instrument you want through MIDI and script out a lead sheet/ instrument sheet if needed.

**WARNING:** We will need to discuss what parts are required and royalty percentages based off of those parts and what your needs are.
